Charts_D3
=========

Bits and pieces pertaining to the D3 visualization toolkit.
Nothing super spiffy here such as plugins and cutting-edge techniques,
but largely some wrappers to simplify our most common use cases of bar charts and pie charts.

Our own use cases (to date, on this project) are pretty simple and I found that I was 
writing the same 30 lines of D3 code with only a half-dozen changes pertaining to the data.
This set of wrapper functions made it super simple to deploy pie charts, bar charts, and word clouds.

To run these examples in the browser without downloading them first,
use Github's preview system:

Enjoy.
